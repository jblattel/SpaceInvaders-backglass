Space Invaders Backglass Clock Project
Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a "new and improved" Space Invaders themed backglass clock project. Inspired by the classic arcade game, this project turns a backglass-style display into a functional clock, blending retro gaming aesthetics with modern timekeeping.

The project likely involves hardware like LED matrices, microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino or ESP32), and software to animate invaders or display time in a creative way mimicking the Space Invaders backglass.

Features
Retro Space Invaders theme
Clock functionality with possible animations
Customizable display options
Improved version with enhancements over previous iterations (e.g., better efficiency, more features)
Requirements
Hardware: [Raspberry PI 2x 8x8 Matrix displays, 4x 7 segment displays, 32 channel I/O driver for lighting]
Software: Python 3 and libraries outlined in import
Build: (more to come on physical build)

Copy
git clone https://github.com/jblattel/SpaceInvaders-backglass.git
Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Arduino IDE).
Install any required libraries via the Library Manager.
Upload the code to your microcontroller.
Usage
Assemble the hardware according to the schematic (see docs/schematic.pdf if available, or refer to project documentation).
Power on the device.
The clock should initialize, sync time (if internet-connected), and display the time with Space Invaders elements.
For customization, edit the code to adjust colors, animation speed, or time format.
